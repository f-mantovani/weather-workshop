# Code Storm - Weather App Workshop

In this repository you will find the finished code for the work as some other useful links that can help you with some of the concepts and methods used during the workshop.

- We will be using the [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) during the workshop, as we won't need an API key and we can grab the informations passing some parameters to the URL.
>
- To work with the URL params in an easier way we'll use the [URLSearchParams()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams).
>
- To request the information to the API we'll use the browser native solution the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
>
- We'll take the use location also using the native solution [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API/Using_the_Geolocation_API)
>
- We also use the namespace [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) to work with the dates and hours.
>
- We'll use [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) for the most of the layouts.
>
- Lastly we'll manipulate what is shown to the user through [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) manipulation.

You have a folder with the finished code on the repository, the images will break if you try to run with the live server directly, so you need to copy and paste all the contents on the root folder or change the path in the `getIcon()` inside the `index.js` and make it go one folder up `../assets/icons/...`

Hope that you have a great time!!
